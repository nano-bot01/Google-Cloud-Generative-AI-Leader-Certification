            <h2 class="section-header text-3xl font-bold">ü§ñ The Anatomy of AI Agents</h2>
            <p class="mt-4">AI agents are a significant leap beyond standalone models. They are designed to observe, act, and achieve goals by combining two key elements: a reasoning loop and tools. ü§ñ</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 text-indigo-700">What Distinguishes AI Agents?</h3>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-4 space-y-3">
                <li>
                    <strong>Reasoning Loop:</strong> This is the agent's "thinking process." It's a continuous, iterative cycle that enables agents to analyze a situation, plan actions, and adapt based on outcomes. The loop consists of four key steps:
                    <ol class="list-decimal ml-6 mt-2 space-y-1">
                        <li>Observes: Gathers information from its environment. üëÄ</li>
                        <li>Interprets: Processes the information to assess the current situation. üß†</li>
                        <li>Plans: Plans a course of action to achieve its goal. üó∫Ô∏è</li>
                        <li>Acts: Executes the planned action. ‚úÖ</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p class="ml-6 mt-1 text-sm text-gray-600">This cycle continues until the goal is met. The complexity of the loop varies from simple rules to complex thought chains and machine learning algorithms.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Tools:</strong> These are functionalities that allow the agent to interact with its environment. Tools enable agents to access data, use software applications, and even communicate with physical robots. üîß This capability allows agents to connect with real-world information and services, much like apps on a phone.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 text-indigo-700">Why They Matter</h3>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-4 space-y-3">
                <li><strong>Solving Complex Problems:</strong> Agents can analyze information, gather data using tools, and make informed decisions with minimal human intervention. üí°</li>
                <li><strong>Managing Multi-Step Tasks:</strong> Agents excel at complex workflows, such as conducting in-depth research, troubleshooting code, and automating tasks across multiple systems. ‚û°Ô∏è</li>
                <li><strong>Producing Diverse Results:</strong> They can move beyond simple text generation to produce results that involve actions in the real world. üåç</li>
            </ul>

            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-4 space-y-3">
                <li><strong>Manual and tedious process:</strong> Their engineers had a hard time getting critical information like material composition and dimensions from complex 3D CAD models. üò´</li>
                <li><strong>Inefficient workflow:</strong> This slow, manual process was prone to errors, which hurt their ability to efficiently design, analyze, and make jet engine components. üìâ</li>

                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Layer 2: Gemini:</strong> They integrated Gemini to transform the raw metadata from the AutoML model into clear, concise summaries in natural language. üó£Ô∏è
                    <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2 space-y-1">
                        <li>This allowed engineers to ask simple questions like, "What is the tensile strength of the turbine blade?", and get an immediate, understandable, and accurate answer.</li>
                        <li>The integration was done using MLOps tools like Vertex AI Pipelines.</li>
                    </ul>

                <li>They allow agents to access information, perform actions, and interact with a variety of systems. ü§ñ</li>
                <li>We can break down agent tools into four key categories:</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 text-indigo-600">üß© The Four Types of Agent Tools</h4>
            <ol class="list-decimal ml-6 mt-4 space-y-3">
                <li>
                    <strong>Extensions (APIs):</strong> These tools act as a bridge between an agent and external APIs (application programming interfaces). üîó
                    <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2 space-y-1">
                        <li>They provide a standardized way for an agent to use an API, no matter the API's specific design.</li>
                        <li>Example: An agent that books travel could use an extension to interact with a travel company's API. The extension handles the technical complexities, so the agent can focus on finding and booking the flight. ‚úàÔ∏è</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Functions:</strong> These are specialized tools within the agent's toolbox that represent specific actions the agent can perform. üìù
                    <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2 space-y-1">
                        <li>An agent's reasoning system will select the correct function based on the task at hand.</li>
                        <li>Functions can encapsulate complex logic, making them reusable and easy to manage.</li>
                        <li>Example: A "calculate_price" function would take flight details and passenger information as input and return the total cost. The agent can then call this function whenever it needs to calculate a price. üí∞</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Data Stores:</strong> These tools give agents access to information. This can include real-time data, historical data, or knowledge bases. üìö
                    <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2 space-y-1">
                        <li>Data stores make sure that an agent's responses are accurate, relevant, and up-to-date.</li>
                        <li>Example: An agent could use a data store to access real-time weather conditions, current stock prices, or a database of customer information. üìà</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Plugins:</strong> Plugins add new skills or integrations to an agent's capabilities. üîå
                    <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2 space-y-1">
                        <li>They can connect an agent to specific services or allow it to interact with particular platforms.</li>
                        <li>Example: A plugin could let an agent interact with a calendar app to schedule appointments. Another might integrate with a payment gateway to process transactions. üí≥</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 text-indigo-700">üó∫Ô∏è Agent Tooling Example: Meeting Location Planner</h3>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-4 space-y-3">
                <li><strong>Scenario:</strong> A user uploads a document with a list of potential venues or meeting invitation details. The agent's goal is to suggest the most convenient meeting location for all attendees. üéØ</li>
                <li><strong>Tools Used:</strong> The agent uses a combination of different tools to achieve its goal:
                    <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2 space-y-1">
                        <li>Document AI API: To understand the content of the uploaded document.</li>
                        <li>Google Maps API: To analyze locations.</li>
                        <li>Custom logic: To suggest the final location.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 text-indigo-600">üîÑ The Agent's Workflow</h4>
            <ol class="list-decimal ml-6 mt-4 space-y-3">
                <li>Document Processing: The agent first uses the Document AI API to process the uploaded document and identify all the addresses mentioned inside it. üìÑ</li>
                <li>Geocoding: Next, it uses the Google Maps Geocoding API to convert the extracted addresses into latitude and longitude coordinates. This allows the agent to calculate distances and travel times. üìç</li>
                <li>Location Analysis: Finally, the agent uses a custom logic (implemented within a Cloud Function) to analyze the geocoded addresses. This helps it determine and suggest the most convenient location for all the attendees. üß†</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="mt-4 text-sm text-gray-600">This example shows how an agent can combine different tools to turn unstructured data (a document) into a helpful and actionable recommendation. ‚ú®</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 text-indigo-700">üß† How RAG Works with Tools (Deep Dive)</h3>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-4 space-y-3">
                <li>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances a large language model (LLM) by grounding its responses in external knowledge sources. üìö</li>
                <li>This allows the model to access and use information beyond its training data, which leads to more accurate, relevant, and up-to-date responses. ‚ú®</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 text-indigo-600">üîÑ The RAG Process with Tools</h4>
            <ol class="list-decimal ml-6 mt-4 space-y-3">
                <li><strong>Retrieval:</strong> The LLM uses retrieval tools to find relevant information from outside sources. üîé These tools can include:
                    <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2 space-y-1">
                        <li>Data stores: Internal databases or other sources of structured and unstructured data. üóÉÔ∏è</li>
                        <li>Vector databases: Store numerical representations of text (embeddings) and find information that is semantically similar to the user's query.</li>
                        <li>Search engines: Used to find relevant web pages, articles, or other online content. üåê</li>
                        <li>Knowledge graphs: Structured databases that store information about entities and their relationships. üîó</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Augmentation:</strong> The retrieved information is then added to the original prompt that is given to the LLM. üìù This augmented prompt now has both the user's request and the relevant context.</li>
                <li><strong>Generation:</strong> The LLM processes the augmented prompt and generates a response. Because it has the external information, the response is more accurate and contextually appropriate. It can also cite its sources, which increases transparency and trustworthiness. ‚úÖ</li>
                <li><strong>Iteration:</strong> In some systems, the LLM can iterate on the retrieval process. If the first search isn't good enough, it can refine its query or use different tools to find better information. It can also ask the user for clarifying questions. üîÑ</li>
            </ol>

            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-4 space-y-3">
                <li>There are two primary ways to build conversational agents: deterministic and generative. The best approach is often a combination of both. ü§ù</li>
                <li><strong>Deterministic agents:</strong> are rule-based and have a very defined system to follow (e.g., if a user presses a certain number, go to a specific route). They are more rigid and typically require low to medium code. ‚öôÔ∏è</li>
                <li><strong>Generative agents:</strong> are based on new generative AI technology and use large language models (LLMs) to give a real conversational feel to a chatbot. They can decide what to do on their own based on a prompt and often require no or low code. üí°</li>
                <li><strong>Hybrid agents:</strong> in Google Cloud combine the strengths of both, offering a powerful solution that provides strict control while still leveraging generative AI's flexibility. ‚ú®</li>
